      <p>The beginning of the internet, or the "web", is somewhere in the early <b>1990's</b>. HTML is the language that computers use in order to request information from each other on the web. HTML is known as a <b>mark-up</b> language.
      </p>
      <p>The internet is made up of roughly <b><em>FOUR</em></b> pieces:
      </p>
      <b>Us (People), the computer, the Web, and the Servers.</b>
      <br>

      <div class="Meaningsummary">           
          <p>For me, the easiest way to remember what HTML does is by simply thinking of it as a language that internet pages use. This helps me understand that it will take some time as most languages do, and that I need to practice and not worry about memorizing so much as understanding the basics of HTML, much like Andy suggests!</p>

      <h3 class="Takeaways">Some Key Takeaways</h3>
        <div class="Keys">
          <p>
            <b>Tags:</b> Some tags require closing, and some tags do not, which are considered VOIDS.<br>
            <b>Elements:</b> This is what an HTML is essentially made up of.<br>
            <b>Attributes:</b> Used with specific tags to make things act, appear, or overall just process specifically different depending on the instruction.<br>
            <b>HTML:</b> Hyper Tet Mark-up Language<br>
            <b>Inline:</b> An element that is in-line with the contents.<br>
            <b>Block:</b> An element that create an invisible box that can be adjusted.<br>
            <b>Hyperlink example:</b> <a href="www.google.com"> <b>Google It!!!</b></a><br>

      <h2 class="PartTwo">Part Two</h2>
        <div class="P2Summary">
        <p>Webpages themselves have a <b>structure</b> that make things a little more organized, as long as you first identify all the elements within a web page as simple boxes. We learned earlier that these <em>boxes</em> can either be <b>in-line</b> or <b>block</b> which can help visualize how elements will appear on each page. By then breaking these down, whether on a piece of paper, on a graphics program, or by simply printing out the word doc and cutting them into squares.
        </p>
        </div>
      <h3 class="Trees">The Tree</h3>
        <div class="treesummary">
          <p>The next thing is to understand how the structure of the webpage cascades. The tree-like description can be misleading, and does not necessarily speak to the actual visual representation, but more of the way the information branches into each subsection. This basically means that each section may contain limbs which then branch of into smaller sections which delve deeper into each subsection.
          </p>

        <h3 class="CSS">CSS</h3>
          <div class="CSSSummary">
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a styling language, which means that we can write code to change the way a webpage looks and feels. The cascading portion of the name suggests that it can either transfer into the section, or classes can be used in order to specify the element to be styled. CSS does not necessarily need to be memorized, but we do need to know where to go when we need help.
